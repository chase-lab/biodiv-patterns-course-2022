## Part 1. 10am-12pm: What is biodiversity? How do you measure and compare it?

I. Lecture (see ppt)

II. Readings (see pdfs)


## Part 2. 12:30pm-3pm: Discussion and lab excercise

I. Discussion of papers, data from last week's trees

II. Lab Excercise 

1. Each student will sample ALL organisms from each of 3 local sites (bags) in a metacommunity (samples will be given at the start of the excercise). Names of species given in ppt.
2. Open up the Google Spreadsheet--https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SGtdU61_3vX43Xtjaq579nEF1xuelRY3Dol2WGKFzUk/edit?usp=sharing
3. Enter data for each 'control' sample in your individual worksheet; enter data for each person in summary 'species richness' sheet for both 'local' and 'metacommunity' richness
4. As a group, calculate 'total' richness of the region (all 6 metacommunities)
5. Experimentally impose 'predation' of 50% of individuals by an introduced predator (e.g., raccoons invading Europe). IMPORTANT: Experimental predation must be **random** (even if what you personally predate is not random)
6. Repeat Step #3 and #4, but with 'impact' data (after predation)
7. Compare species accumulation curves at 3 different spatial scales (1 local sample-->3 samples in a metacommunity-->entire region) for both 'control' and 'impact'
8. Calculate log ratio effect sizes of species richness loss for each scale
