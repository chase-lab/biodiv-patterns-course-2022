## Morning session (09:30h - 12:00h)

- How can we describe biodiversity numerically?  
- Accumulation curves and the Species Abundance Distribution
- R packages for calculating biodiversity metrics
- Calculating compositional differences between samples


## Afternoon session (13:00h -  max 16:00h)

Measuring and comparing biodiversity in the meta-community model(s) from week 1,
including reshaping data to fit your needs  

1) calculate metrics on the 2 different competition simulations from week 1
2) tweak the model to simulate something else: 
        Options: 
        a) differences in dispersal capacity
        b) changing environment (climate change?)
        c) ...
        And calculate your metrics across scales
        
 3) optional: simulate many different landscapes and compare these.
