## Overview of Coexistence and Diversity in Metacommunities

The primary objective of todays work will be to introduce students to metacommunities. A metacommunity is just an expansion of a community (a local patch) in time and space. Coexistence in metacommunities is influenced both by local processes (e.g., competition, predation) and by regional processes (dispersal, habitat heterogeneity). Although somewhat abstract, the metacommunity concept forms the basis for thinking about the maintenance of biodiversity across space and time. 

## Part 1. Sampling tree metacommunities in Halle Forests

Objective: Observe tree species diversity (numbers of species, relative abundances) and tree species composition (names and types of trees) in multiple forests within the Halle (Saale) region. Use these observations as a basis for thinking about what influence the numbers and types of species in a given area, and how they change across space and time

Methods: Each of you (or you can work in twos or threes) should collect data from (at least) 3 different forest plots in Halle. You have to decide what a 'plot' means, but it should contain enough individual trees (e.g., at least 10, but not more than 50) so that you can calculate some metrics of diversity. For each 'plot', write down the name of the species and the number of individuals that you observed in your plot. Only count species that are bigger than a 'sapling' (roughly 5 cm dbh and larger). You also have to decide what 'different' means among the 3 plots you sample.  However, I strongly suggest you try to find plots that differ in their habitat (e.g., wet/dry, hilly/flat, urban/natural), so that you can observe different kinds of trees in different kinds of habitats. Importantly, however, don't overdo it. Use good methods, but don't be overly strict about size of plot (you can use the size of your pace to measure meters).  Overall, this excercise should allow you to spend ~30 minutes per site. (For a total of 2-3 hours in the forest making observations and collecting data). 


Strong Recommendation: Use the 'Flora Incognita' app on your smartphone.  It's developed at the MPI in Jena (and elsewhere) and uses quite good AI for plant ID. If you can't get it to species, just write the genus or some description for the species. The key is to try to tell species apart
