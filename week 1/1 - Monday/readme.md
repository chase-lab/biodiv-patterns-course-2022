## Overview of Coexistence and Diversity in Metacommunities

The primary objective of todays work will be to introduce students to metacommunities. A metacommunity is just an expansion of a community (a local patch) in time and space. Coexistence in metacommunities is influenced both by local processes (e.g., competition, predation) and by regional processes (dispersal, habitat heterogeneity). Although somewhat abstract, the metacommunity concept forms the basis for thinking about the maintenance of biodiversity across space and time. 

## Part 1. Sampling tree metacommunities in Halle Forests

Objective: Observe tree species diversity (numbers of species, relative abundances) and tree species composition (names and types of trees) in multiple forests within the Halle (Saale) region. Use these observations as a basis for thinking about what influence the numbers and types of species in a given area, and how they change across space and time




Strong Recommendation: Use the 'Flora Incognita' app on your smartphone.  It's developed at the MPI in Jena (and others) and uses quite good AI for plant ID. If you can't get it to species, just write the genus or some description for the species. The key is to try to tell species apart

And here are a few sites that can help with winter ID (look at the buds and bark)
