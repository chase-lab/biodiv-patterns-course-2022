## Overview of Coexistence and Diversity in Metacommunities

The primary objective of todays work will be to introduce students to metacommunities. A metacommunity is just an expansion of a community (a local patch) in time and space. Coexistence in metacommunities is influenced both by local processes (e.g., competition, predation) and by regional processes (dispersal, habitat heterogeneity). Although somewhat abstract, the metacommunity concept forms the basis for thinking about the maintenance of biodiversity across space and time.
