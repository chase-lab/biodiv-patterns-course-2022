**Project. Water-bird diversity, ‘functional’ diversity, and their role in ecosystems**

Question: How does water-bird diversity and functional diversity vary between sites?  How does this influence their role in the functioning of ecosystems?

***Diversity and Functional Diversity:***

Alternative Hypothesis 1: Both taxonomic and functional diversity increase at the same rate

Alternative Hypothesis 2: Taxonomic diversity increases more than functional diversity

***Role in Ecosystem Functioning***

Alternative Hypothesis 1: Diversity and/or functional diversity will not influence the functioning of ecosystems

Alternative Hypothesis 2: Diversity and/or functional diversity will influence the functioning of ecosystems

**Experimental steps:**
1. Buy some bread (or use leftover bread from your house). I would suggest sliced ‘white’ bread, as it tends to float better, but any will do as long as it’s not too dense.  Make sure you have enough for use at two different observational sites (I would estimate ~2 loaves, one for each site. Plus a bit more to ‘seed’ the water to get the birds attracted to the area before you start collecting data). Break it up into small(ish) pieces that are large enough to float, but small enough so that most species can eat it.

2. Choose (at least) two experimental sites that you strongly suspect have different levels of diversity of water birds (ducks, geese, swans, coots, etc). These can be ponds, fountains, rivers, lakes, etc. For example, a pond in the city might have fewer species of ducks than a pond in the park. For example, most urban ponds and streams will have mallard ducks and maybe one or two other species (e.g., coots). But the one in the park might also have more species of ducks, as well as other types of water-birds (e.g., geese, swans), and other water-birds. You can check, for example, iNaturalist to see which local water bodies are frequented by which birds.

3. At each water body, look around and identify the numbers and types of water-birds you see in a given sample area (can be an estimate, but keep track of abundance and species in a roughly similar area). Focus primarily on bird species that can eat the bread (ducks, geese, swans, coots). But also note any other primarily water birds you observe (herons, cormorants) and differences in their diets, traits, etc.

4. *Measuring Functional Diversity*. Take note of differences in the ‘functional traits’ of species you observe. This will be up to you, but for example, coots are smaller, have smaller beaks, are faster, etc. Ducks have short necks, geese and swans have long necks, etc. Try to put species/traits into categories. Some traits that you use to tell species apart (e.g., color, feather crests) will not likely have any functional role, so avoid using those traits.

5. *Measuring ecosystem functioning*. Experimentally estimate the capability of the community of birds that you have observed to influence their ecosystem via consumption. I suggest the following rough design, though feel free to modify it in any way you wish.

   a. prime the area by throwing a small amount of bread into the water, to get the birds to notice the food and start feeding.
  
   b. throw the food out all at once so that there is a large volume of food in the water.
  
   c. using a stop watch, time how long it takes for all of the food to be consumed by the birds.
  
   d. if it is not consumed within 10 minutes, estimate the proportion of food that was left unconsumed. Also try to note how many items of food sink and are not consumed (or are consumed by fish instead).
