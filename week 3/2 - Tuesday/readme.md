## Part I: Introduction to Functional Trait Diversity. Morning session (10 – 12)
  
  - Facets of biodiversity, how do they complement taxonomic diversity?
  - Functional ecology and functional diversity (terminology clarification).
  - Functional traits and trait-based approaches.
  - How to estimate functional diversity based on traits (Anne Chao et al approach).
  - Exercise: Hill numbers and distance-based approach (trait distinctiveness) to estimate functional trait diversity (Anne Chao et al approach).

## Part II: 

  - Additional estimations of functional trait diversity: trait-value-based approach.
  - Multidimensional trait space and species trait combinations.
  - Plant strategies according to their traits.
  - Exercise: Functional richness, evenness, dispersion (Cornwell et al. 2006 approach and Blonder et al approach).
